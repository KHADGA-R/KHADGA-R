I'm a passionate and results-driven Java Developer with hands-on experience building scalable enterprise applications using Java, Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and cloud-native DevOps practices. I currently work at Infosys as a Technology Analyst, where I contribute to digital transformation projects for Nike Inc., focusing on robust backend development, CI/CD, and automated testing.
